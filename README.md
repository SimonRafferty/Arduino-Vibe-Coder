## Prerequisites

### 1. AI Assistant Setup

#### Option A: Claude AI Setup
**Get your API key from Anthropic:**
1. Visit https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Go to "API Keys" in your account settings
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (it starts with `sk-ant-`)

**Note:** Claude API usage is pay-per-use. Check Anthropic's pricing for current rates.

#### Option B: LMStudio Setup
**Download and Install LMStudio:**
1. Visit https://lmstudio.ai/
2. Download LMStudio for your operating system
3. Install and run LMStudio

**Configure LMStudio:**
1. **Download a Model:**
   - In LMStudio, go to the "Search" tab
   - Search for Arduino/coding-capable models like:
     - `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium` (lightweight, good for basic tasks)
     - `codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-GGUF` (excellent for code generation)
     - `TheBloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-GGUF` (specialized for coding)
     - `microsoft/WizardCoder-Python-7B-V1.0-GGUF` (good for code)
   - Download your preferred model (7B models work well on most systems)

2. **Load the Model:**
   - Go to "Local Server" tab in LMStudio
   - Select your downloaded model
   - Click "Load Model"
   - Wait for the model to load (you'll see memory usage)

3. **Start the Server:**
   - In the "Local Server" tab, make sure these settings are configured:
     - **Server Port:** `1234` (default)
     - **Cross-Origin-Requests:** Enabled
     - **Apply chat template:** Enabled (for instruct models)
   - Click "Start Server"
   - You should see "Server running on http://localhost:1234"

4. **Test the Connection:**
   - The status should show "Server online"
   - You can test the API at http://localhost:1234/v1/models

**Arduino Vibe Coder automatically maintains conversation context for LMStudio**, so the AI will remember your code and previous questions throughout your session. It also includes your currently selected board in the context for better pin and feature recommendations.

**Recommended Models for Arduino Development:**
- **CodeLlama-7b-Instruct:** Best overall for code generation
- **DeepSeek-Coder:** Specialized for coding tasks
- **WizardCoder:** Good balance of performance and size
- **Larger models (13B+):** Better quality but require more RAM

**Model Requirements:**
- **7B models:** ~8GB RAM minimum
- **13B models:** ~16GB RAM minimum  
- **34B models:** ~32GB RAM minimum
- GPU acceleration available if you have compatible GPU

### 2. Install Node.js

**Download:** https://nodejs.org/
- Choose the LTS version (recommended for most users)
- Run the installer with default settings
- Verify installation: Open Command Prompt and type `node --version`

### 3. Install Arduino CLI

**Easy Method (Recommended):**
1. Download `arduino-cli.exe` from: https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/installation/
2. **Put `arduino-cli.exe` directly in your project folder** (same folder as `start.bat`)
3. That's it! No PATH configuration needed.

**Alternative Method:**
1. Download the Windows zip file and extract somewhere (e.g., `C:\arduino-cli\`)
2. Add the folder to your PATH (see Environment Variables in Windows)

**Verify installation:** 
- If using local method: Double-click `arduino-cli.exe` (should show help)
- If using PATH method: Open Command Prompt and type `arduino-cli version`

### 4. Configure Arduino CLI for Your Boards

**The Vibe Coder will automatically detect boards from your existing Arduino IDE installation.** If you need additional boards:

**ESP32 Setup:**
```bash
arduino-cli core update-index --additional-urls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
```

**Teensy Setup:**
```bash
arduino-cli core update-index --additional-urls https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/package_teensy_index.json
arduino-cli core install teensy:avr
```

**Additional Arduino Boards:**
```bash
arduino-cli core update-index
arduino-cli core install arduino:samd    # For MKR boards, Nano 33 IoT, etc.
arduino-cli core install arduino:mbed_nano  # For Nano 33 BLE
```

*Note: The web interface will automatically show all boards from your installed cores.*

- Your code and projects remain on your local machine

## Safety Notes

**For Embedded Development:**
- Always test code in safe environments before deploying to production
- Use proper isolation and protection for high-voltage or high-current applications
- Follow standard electrical safety practices and component ratings
- This tool is for development and prototyping - production systems should have additional safety layers and testing
- Be mindful of proper power supply design and thermal considerations

**For AI-Generated Code:**
- Always review AI-generated code before uploading to hardware
- Test in safe conditions before connecting to real-world systems
- AI can make mistakes - use your engineering judgment
